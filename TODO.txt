Engine Work:

[x] Entity
	An entity has:
	-size for hitbox
	-position

[x] Entity-Tilemap collisions
	- Needs to slide on collision with wall
	- TODO needs bugtesting

[x] Entity-Entity collision detection

[ ] Level system
	levels track:
		entities
		tilemap data
		tilemap chunks
			to optimize rendering, the tilemap is broken into individual meshes. The actual tilemap data is stored as a single giant array to make accessing easier
	
[ ] Level quadtree for optimized entity collision

[x] Tilemap system
	Tilemaps track the size of their tiles, the atlas texture, their uv coords, etc

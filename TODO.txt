Engine Work:

	DONE:
		Entity
			An entity has:
			-size for hitbox
			-position

		Entity-Tilemap collisions
			- Needs to slide on collision with wall

		Entity-Entity collisions

	WIP:
		Level system
			levels track:
				entities
				tilemap data
				tilemap chunks
					to optimize rendering, the tilemap is broken into individual meshes. The actual tilemap data is stored as a single giant array to make accessing easier
